[Bad To Good Emails](https://badtogoodemails.com) is a B2B email correction platform powered by proprietary AI agents designed to help businesses improve the performance of their outreach campaigns. Unlike traditional email validation tools that simply tell you if an email is "valid" or "invalid," our AI agents go further — they find and return the **correct, deliverable B2B email address** when yours is wrong.

## The Problem We Solve

Email validation tools are great for B2C emails (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.), but they struggle with B2B. Here's why:

- An employee leaves a company, but their email stays active
- Validation tools check the email and say **"Valid"** — because the mailbox technically exists
- You send your campaign, but it goes nowhere — or worse, it hits a **spam trap**
- Your sender reputation drops, and even emails to real contacts start landing in spam

**"Valid" doesn't mean "correct."** Validation tools can't tell you if a real person is behind that email address. We can.

## What We Do

Our AI agents scan your B2B contact list and identify emails that won't reach real people. When our agents find a bad email, they don't just flag it — they autonomously research and discover the **correct email address** for that contact.

**You only pay when our AI agents deliver a new, correct email.** No results, no charge.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous AI Agents:** Our proprietary AI agents analyze your contact list, identify emails that won't reach real people, and autonomously discover the correct, deliverable B2B email address. No manual research required.

- **Intelligent Catch-All Resolution:** Many B2B domains accept all emails (catch-all), making traditional validation useless. Our AI agents determine if the email reaches a real person and find the correct address if it doesn't.

- **Consumer to B2B Conversion:** Have a contact's personal email but need their business email? Our AI agents can locate their B2B email address when you provide the company name (and optionally first/last name for improved accuracy).

- **Contextual Name Matching:** Providing first and last name along with company information allows our AI agents to dramatically improve accuracy in finding the correct email.

- **B2B Specialized Intelligence:** Our AI agents are trained specifically for B2B email discovery. No consumer domains — just real B2B contacts that drive conversions.

## What We Accept

Send us your problem emails:

- **Invalid & Bounced:** Emails that hard bounced or were marked invalid by validation tools
- **Unknown & Risky:** Emails flagged as risky, unknown, or unverifiable
- **Unconfirmed "Good" Emails:** Emails that passed validation but aren't converting
- **Consumer Emails:** Personal emails where you know the contact's company (we'll find their B2B address)

## How It Works

1. **Upload Your B2B Emails:** Send us your problematic emails via CSV upload or API. Include company name and contact names for best results.

2. **AI Agents Discover Correct Emails:** Our autonomous AI agents analyze each contact, research the organization, and discover the correct, deliverable B2B email address.

3. **Download & Start Converting:** Get back a clean list of correct B2B emails ready to drive real results for your campaigns.

## Integration and APIs

Bad To Good Emails offers a powerful API to deploy our AI agents within your existing systems:

- **CRM Integration:** Connect with Salesforce, HubSpot, and other CRM platforms
- **ESP Connectivity:** Integrate with your Email Service Provider workflows
- **Custom Workflows:** Easily deploy our AI agents into your own applications and processes
- **Real-Time Processing:** Trigger AI agents on-demand as contacts enter your system
- **Bulk Processing:** Upload large CSV files for batch AI-powered correction

## Why This Matters

Bad B2B email data doesn't just waste your time — it actively hurts your business:

- **Spam Traps:** Old employee emails often become spam traps. Hit enough of them and you're flagged as a spammer.
- **Reputation Damage:** Every email to a non-existent person hurts your sender score. Low scores mean low deliverability.
- **Blacklisted Domains:** Enough bad sends and your entire domain gets blacklisted. Recovery takes months.
- **Lost Revenue:** Every email that doesn't reach a real person is a missed opportunity.

## We Fill the Gap

Email validation companies do a great job with consumer emails. But B2B is different. We don't compete with validation tools — we fill the gap they can't address.
